          <h2>About the Coalition</h2>
          <p>The New York High-Impact Tutoring Coalition brings together educators, nonprofit organizations, civil rights advocates, service providers, and groups representing students, parents, and educators that have come together to advocate for the sustained investment in high-quality tutoring across New York State.</p>
          <p>Founded in response to the urgent learning recovery needs following the pandemic, the coalition recognizes that high-impact tutoring is one of the most effective interventions for accelerating student learning and closing opportunity gaps.</p>

          <h2>What is High-Impact Tutoring?</h2>
          <p>High-impact tutoring is a data-driven, research-backed practice that substantially improves academic outcomes and supports student wellbeing.</p>
          <div class="need-this-now">
            <h3>Why New York Needs This Now</h3>
            <p>According to the 2024 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) New York students remain <strong class="emphasis">below pre-pandemic levels</strong> in fourth grade reading and eighth grade math, which are critical indicators of future academic success. Furthermore, NAEP scores show that <strong class="emphasis">more than half of Black and Latinx students</strong> in New York scored 'Below Basic' in both fourth grade reading and eighth grade math.</p>
            <p>High-Impact Tutoring provides access to a research-based intervention method that significantly boosts outcomes for at-risk students. Yielding a <strong class="emphasis">$6 to $17 return on every dollar invested</strong>, HIT is a cost effective way to increase critical math and literacy skills.</p>
          </div>
          <p>Unlike traditional tutoring that is often classified as "homework help," High-Impact Tutoring is a unique and intentional approach to instructional support defined by the following parameters:</p>
          <div class="parameters-container fade-in-right">
            <div class="parameters-left">
              <!-- vertical line for timeline -->

                <div>
                  <h4>Consistent & Frequent</h4>
                  <p>Tutors meet with students at least 3 times per week for a 10 week cycle.</p>
                </div>

                  <h4>Low Ratio</h4>
                  <p>A trained tutor works with students in a small group of 1-to-4 or less.</p>

                  <h4>Relationship-Based</h4>
                  <p>A consistent tutor is trained to build strong, supportive relationships with their students for the full duration of the 10 week cycle.</p>

                  <h4>High Quality Curriculum</h4>
                  <p>Programs use standards-based materials that are aligned to the school's curriculum and goals.</p>
                </div>
              </div>

                <div>
                  <h4>Proven Effective</h4>
                  <p>Research shows HIT is 3-5 times more effective than other common interventions, with students gaining an average of 9 months of additional learning in a single academic year.</p>
