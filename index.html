          <h2>What is High-Impact Tutoring?</h2>
          <p>High-impact tutoring is a data-driven, research-backed practice that substantially improves academic outcomes and supports student wellbeing.</p>
          <div class="need-this-now">
            <h3>Why New York Needs This Now</h3>
            <p>According to the 2024 National Assessment of Educational Progress (NAEP) New York students remain <strong class="emphasis">below pre-pandemic levels</strong> in fourth grade reading and eighth grade math, which are critical indicators of future academic success. Furthermore, NAEP scores show that <strong class="emphasis">more than half of Black and Latinx students</strong> in New York scored 'Below Basic' in both fourth grade reading and eighth grade math.</p>
            <p>High-Impact Tutoring provides access to a research-based intervention method that significantly boosts outcomes for at-risk students. Yielding a <strong class="emphasis">$6 to $17 return on every dollar invested</strong>, HIT is a cost effective way to increase critical math and literacy skills.</p>
          </div>
          <p>Unlike traditional tutoring that is often classified as "homework help," High-Impact Tutoring is a unique and intentional approach to instructional support defined by the following parameters:</p>
          <div class="parameters-container fade-in-right">
            <div class="parameters-left">
              <!-- vertical line for timeline -->

              <div class="parameter">
                <div class="timeline-number">1</div>
                <div>
                  <h4>Consistent & Frequent</h4>
                  <p>Tutors meet with students at least 3 times per week for a 10 week cycle.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                  <h4>Low Ratio</h4>
                  <p>A trained tutor works with students in a small group of 1-to-4 or less.</p>
                </div>

                <div>
                  <h4>Relationship-Based</h4>
                  <p>A consistent tutor is trained to build strong, supportive relationships with their students for the full duration of the 10 week cycle.</p>

                  <h4>Data-Driven</h4>
                  <p>Programs leverage data to inform enrollment, content, and program evaluation.</p>

                <div>
                  <h4>High Quality Curriculum</h4>
                  <p>Programs use standards-based materials that are aligned to the school's curriculum and goals.</p>
                </div>
              </div>

                <div>
                  <h4>Proven Effective</h4>
                  <p>Research shows HIT is 3-5 times more effective than other common interventions, with students gaining an average of 9 months of additional learning in a single academic year.</p>
